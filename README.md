## 🍪🧃🥗 Hacktiv Typescript 🥗🧃🍪

- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
- Development-Time Error Catching: Unlike JavaScript, which throws errors while the app is running (runtime), TypeScript identifies bugs while you’re writing the code (compile-time). This prevents many "undefined is not a function" headaches.
- Enhanced IDE Support: Because the language understands the data structures, editors like VS Code can provide intelligent autocomplete (IntelliSense), easier navigation, and more reliable automated refactoring.
- This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
- Interfaces and Custom Types: TypeScript allows you to define complex "blueprints" for objects using interface or type. This ensures that every object in your app follows a strict, predictable shape.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
- Future-Proof Syntax: TypeScript allows you to use the latest ECMAScript features (like optional chaining or nullish coalescing) even if you are targeting older browsers, as it transpiles the code down to a compatible version of JavaScript.
- In JavaScript, functions parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
- TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
- For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.
