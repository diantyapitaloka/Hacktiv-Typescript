## 🍪🧃🥗 Hacktiv Typescript 🥗🧃🍪

- TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
- This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
- In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
- TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
- For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.
